* Ok, so you wanna know something about me?
* Yeah that makes kind of sense since you sit here and look at me coding.
*
* I'm Max, 21 Years old (I really hope I update this site regularly to keep this up to date :sweating:)
* and I live in Stuttgart, Germany.
* I'm currently enrolled at the Heilbronn University and study 'Software Engineering' in the fifth semester.
*
* Programming and developing is my absolute passion and I do both 'hacky' stuff (like this website, which works
* but definitely isn't for some production use) and professional implementations for production environments.
* I love to work with people and learn something new everyday to bring both my programming skill and my
* soft skills to the next level.
